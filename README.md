A website that prompts the user to guess the age of randomly-selected US-based celebrities. A correct guess is worth 10 points. One point is deducted for each year the guess is off by (i.e. a guess of 53 for a 55-year-old celebrity is worth 10 - (55 - 53) == 8 points.)

Includes custom CSS styling and an API call (to Wikipedia for the celebrity's date of birth).
